RCFE SCRAPER - SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=================================

SIMPLE VERSION:
---------------
Follow these steps to get the scraper working:

1. Install the required tool (Playwright):
   Open your terminal and run these commands:

   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install chromium

2. Run the scraper:

   python3 rcfe_scraper.py

3. Watch it work!
   A browser window will open automatically, go to the website,
   and download the file. The file will be saved in a folder called "data"

4. Find your downloaded data:
   Look in the "data" folder - you'll see two files:
   - rcfe_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv (timestamped version)
   - rcfe_data_latest.csv (always the most recent download)


TECHNICAL VERSION:
------------------
1. Install dependencies:
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install chromium

2. Run the scraper:
   python3 rcfe_scraper.py

   The script will:
   - Launch a Chromium browser instance
   - Navigate to the CCLD download page
   - Locate and click the RCFE download link
   - Handle the confirmation dialog
   - Download the file to ./data directory
   - Save both timestamped and "latest" versions

3. Configuration options:
   - To run in background (no visible browser):
     Edit rcfe_scraper.py, line 32, change headless=False to headless=True

   - To change download directory:
     Edit rcfe_scraper.py, line 9, change default download_dir value


SETTING UP WEEKLY AUTOMATION:
-----------------------------
SIMPLE: To make this run automatically every week, we'll need to set up
a scheduled task. Let me know when you're ready for that step!

TECHNICAL: Use cron (macOS/Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to schedule
weekly execution. Example cron entry for Monday at 9 AM:
0 9 * * 1 cd /Users/anneneville-bonilla/Documents/claude-test && /usr/bin/python3 rcfe_scraper.py


TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
- If the browser doesn't open: Make sure playwright browsers are installed
  Run: playwright install chromium

- If it can't find the RCFE link: The website structure may have changed.
  The script tries multiple strategies to find it. Check the error output.

- If download fails: Check your internet connection and that the CCLD
  website is accessible.
